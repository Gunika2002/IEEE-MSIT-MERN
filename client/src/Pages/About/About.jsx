                            IEEE MSIT has a pivitol role to play in advancing technological pursuits and social networking of MSIT. Since it's inception in 2009, it has played a forward role in providing it's members a platform to interact, collaborate and work towards a building a technically sound ecosystem. IEEE MSIT WIE, PES, MTTS, CS chapters have worked in cohesion to explore and bring forth various engineering avenues and opportunities such as hackathons, seminars, hands-on workshops, industrial visits, women empowerment seminars, technical project exhibitions, STEP programmes and a lot more.
